<h1>Financial Calculator Project</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The Financial Calculator program contains two different financial calculators:  
<ol>
  <li>Investment Calculator - calculates interest earned on an initial investment.</li>
  <li>Bond Calculator - calculates the monthly repayments on a home loan over a given period of time.</li>
</ol>

<br>
The user is provided the option of using either calculator as many times as they wish while the program runs.

<h2>Installation:</h2>
Please ensure you have installed the latest version of Python.  
Download the finance_calculators.py file from this repository.  
You should then be able to run the Python file directly or via your IDE.

<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
The program contains instructions at every stage, allowing the user to navigate the program.
<h4>Investment Calculator</h4>
The Investment Calculator asks the user to input the following information:  
<ul>
  <li>Initial sum to be invested</li>
  <li>Interest rate</li>
  <li>Length of investment (in years)</li>
  <li>Type of interest: simple or compound (For an explainer: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042315/what-difference-between-compounding-interest-and-simple-interest.asp">click here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<br>
The final total sum and amount of interest earned are then calculated and returned by the program.  

<h4>Bond Calculator</h4>
The Bond Calculator asks the user to input the following information:  
<ul>
  <li>Present value of the house</li>
  <li>Annual interest rate on the home loan</li>
  <li>Length of investment (in years)</li>
  <li>Number of months to repay the loan</li>
</ul>

The total monthly repayment amount is then calculated and returned by the program.  

<h2>Credits</h2>
The inspiration for the project was a practical task required as part of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/hyperion-development-south-africa/">HyperionDev</a>'s Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering (Fundamentals) Bootcamp.
